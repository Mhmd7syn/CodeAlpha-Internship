*Note: You Can Use the executable files to setup the programs or use the source code

*Projects:
1- Number Guessing Game:

Description: The Number Guessing Game project involves the creation of an interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player's objective is to guess the correct number. The game provides helpful hints such as "too high" or "too low" to guide the player towards the correct answer.

2- Basic File Manager:

Description: The Basic File Manager project presents a command-line interface file manager written in C++. Users can navigate directories, view files, create new directories, and copy or move files within the file system. This project leverages C++ file-handling mechanisms to achieve efficient and reliable file management functionalities.

3- Sudoku Solver:

Description: The Sudoku Solver project is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a sophisticated algorithm capable of handling puzzles of varying difficulty levels. The implementation includes the option to interact with the program through a graphical user interface (GUI), providing a user-friendly environment for puzzle-solving.


*Key Features:

- Utilizes the Qt framework for graphical interfaces.
- Written in C++ to leverage the language's power and efficiency.
- Demonstrates proficiency in handling random number generation, file operations, and algorithmic problem-solving.
- Offers a diverse range of applications, from interactive games to practical file management and puzzle-solving tools.
